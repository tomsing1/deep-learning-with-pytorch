# Deep Learning with PyTorch

This repository documents my progress of working through the 
[Deep Learning with PyTorch](https://github.com/deep-learning-with-pytorch/dlwpt-code)
book and the associated code examples.

The book contains three parts:

- Part 1: an introduction into deep learning modules and PyTorch.
  - Datasets are usually small, and the code often uses data sources that
    can be loaded with built-in PyTorch functions. This allowed me to
    work through the chapters using Google Colab.
- Part 2: developing ML models to analyze Ct scans for cancer detection.
  - The full [LUNA16](https://zenodo.org/record/3723295)
    dataset is relatively large (~ 225 Gb of uncompressed images), exceeding
    the storage available in Google Colab. 
- Part 3: Deployment

## Table of contents

I have documented my learning steps, e.g. setting up a cloud workstation, or
the download & storage of the LUNA16 dataset, in the `docs` folder:

- [Setting up a cloud workstation](docs/0_setting_up_a_cloud_workstation.md)
- [Data retrieval and storage](docs/1_data_retrieval.md)
