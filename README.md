# Deep Learning with PyTorch

[This repository](https://github.com/tomsing1/deep-learning-with-pytorch)
documents my progress of working through the 
[Deep Learning with PyTorch](https://github.com/deep-learning-with-pytorch/dlwpt-code)
book and the associated code examples.

The book contains three parts:

- Part 1: an introduction into deep learning modules and PyTorch.
- Part 2: developing ML models to analyze Ct scans for cancer detection.
- Part 3: Deployment

## Table of contents

I have documented my learning steps, e.g. setting up a cloud workstation, or
the download & storage of the LUNA16 dataset, in the `docs` folder:

- [Setting up a cloud workstation](docs/0_setting_up_a_cloud_workstation.md)
- [Data retrieval and storage](docs/1_data_retrieval.md)
